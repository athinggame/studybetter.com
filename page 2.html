<h3>Hi! Welcome Back Again!</h3>

<h7>Do you always procrastinate or are you familiar with word "cram" or "cramming"?<br>
Let me give you some quick recap.<br></h7>

<h3>Did you know that research found that over 30% of students report problems concentrating on their studies. 
<br>Most of these students blame outside distractions for their problems. That's why in our website we give you some
study techniques that can actually help you to study smarter not harder.<br>

Based on our research, cramming can seemingly a quick fix for last-minute studying, negatively impacts students by increasing stress, <br>hindering long-term retention, and potentially leading to poor academic performance and burnout. 



<h5><br>
Here's a more detailed look at the effects of cramming:

Negative Impacts of Cramming:

<br>
<li>Increased Stress and Anxiety:
<br>The pressure to rapidly absorb large amounts of information can lead to significant stress and anxiety.

<br>
<li>Poor Long-Term Retention:
<br>Cramming primarily relies on short-term memory, making it difficult to retain information for extended periods. 

<br>
<li>Reduced Comprehension:
<br>The focus on memorization rather than understanding can lead to a superficial grasp of the material. 

<br>
<li>Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue:
<br>Cramming often involves staying up late, which can lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, further impairing cognitive function. 

<br>
<li>Burnout and Reduced Motivation:
<br>The cycle of cramming and poor performance can lead to burnout and a decline in motivation for future studies. 

<li>    Negative Impact on Mental Health:
<br>The stress and anxiety associated with cramming can also contribute to broader mental health issues. 

<br>
<li>Impaired Cognitive Function:
<br>Lack of sleep and stress can negatively affect cognitive function, making it harder to concentrate and process information. 

<br>
<li>Ineffective Study Habits:
<br>Cramming reinforces poor study habits and can hinder the development of effective learning strategies. 

<br>
<li>Short-Term Focus:
<br>Cramming prioritizes short-term exam performance over long-term learning and understanding.
