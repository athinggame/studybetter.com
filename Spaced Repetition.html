        <h1>Spaced Repetition Study Technique</h1>

        <p><strong>Spaced repetition</strong> is a learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasing intervals to enhance long-term memory retention and combat forgetting. It contrasts with "cramming" by focusing on distributed practice over time, rather than intense, short-term learning.</p>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How it works:</h2>
            <p>Spaced repetition leverages the "forgetting curve," which shows how we naturally lose information over time. By strategically reviewing material before it's forgotten, you reinforce memory and improve long-term retention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Recall:</strong> Spaced repetition often involves active recall, where you try to remember information from memory rather than passively rereading it.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Intervals:</strong> The intervals between reviews are gradually increased, starting with short intervals and then moving to longer ones.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
            <h2>Examples:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviewing lecture notes a few hours after class, then again a day later, and then a week later.</li>
                <li>Using flashcards or apps like Anki to review vocabulary or concepts at increasing intervals.</li>
                <li>Revisiting study materials on a schedule, such as 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after initial learning.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved long-term memory retention.</li>
                <li>More efficient learning compared to cramming.</li>
                <li>Reinforcement of learning through repeated recall.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="apps">
            <h2>Spaced Repetition Apps:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Anki and Remnote are popular apps for spaced repetition.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithms">
            <h2>Spaced Repetition Algorithms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are different algorithms used in spaced repetition systems, including the Leitner system, SM family of algorithms, and DASH family.</li>
